# Alpha: A 2D Game Engine and Editor

This is a 2D game engine and editor developed in Rust to help me learn more about the language and about game development.

NEXT:
- "Scripting".
- Render filled a circle.
- Render shape outlines.

NICE TO HAVE:
- Highlight selected entity.
- Highlight entity on mouse hover.
- Save and load editor state (and game config) using HECS serde traits.
