# Alpha: A 2D Game Engine and Editor

This is a 2D game engine and editor developed in Rust to help me learn more about the language and about game development.

NEXT:
- Scene hierarchy panel to select entities.
- Select entities using mouse in scene viewer.
- Save and load editor state (and game config) using HECS serde traits.
