# Alpha: A 2D Game Engine and Editor

This is a 2D game engine and editor developed in Rust to help me learn more about the language and about game development.

NEXT:
- Rotate the quad and play/pause in the editor with the `P` key.
- Set the color of the quad via a buffer.
- Configure the colour of the quad by loading from a file.
- Set the colour of the quad in the editor and save to the file.
